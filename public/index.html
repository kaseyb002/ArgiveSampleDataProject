Why can we not leave requirements in permit (dush shall not cross the property line andbe a nuisence) and leave it up to industry to accomplish the goals without being required to apply xx amount of water each run/day and documenting the information?" - June 22</p>

                <p class="quote">"Improve Chapter 6 - 10.6.045 Open Burning Requirements citizens are required to obtain an open burning permit through the state (with local Fire Dept. having to approve permit as well) to dispose of vegetative waste in the Kansas City Metropolitan area. Permit is cumbersome to the citizens, local fire departments, and DNR; unnecessary as it is not required anywhere else in the State. If a local city/ county/fire district wants to regulate open burning of vegetative waste with permits, so be it." - July 12</p>

                <p class="quote">"Missouri state vehicle inspection and emissions program is a huge government bureaucratic overreach to force EVERY vehicle into a shop for a “safety” inspection. I understand the importance of vehicle safety but this has just gone too far over the years and it’s getting worse. I think it’s time we reign it in. Regarding the emission inspection portion, this needs to be revised also. The test applies to all cars with the OBDII system on it. This goes all the way back to 1996. So a car that is currently 21 years old is expected to hold the same emission standards as a brand new car? That’s completely unreasonable! Again, I’m all for clean air and water just like President Trump. But this seems like a huge corrupt overreach." - July 14</p>

                <p class="quote">"We are attempting to add an additional paint booth to support an increased workload and to become more efficient. We already have three operational paint booths and have passed every Missouri DNR inspection we have been subject to. We have our eyes on a booth we'd like to add, but Platinum will be forced to pay a state engineer to review and approve the permit. In light of Missouri's new and very appreciated commitment to small business, we would hope that our tax dollars would be sufficient to cover the cost for a state funded agency to approve our permit. In addition, we have been informed that it will take up to three months to gain approval for the new booth. By then, the potential work may have dried up. " - Jeff, Aug 1</p>

                <p class="quote">"One of our issues we have now is the time it takes for the approval and issuing a permit of a paint booth we are needing to secure more work. We have been told that it takes up to three months to approve for a permit. Also we will be charged seventy five dollars an hour for an engineer to review and approve the permit. We believe that being charged extra for something that is being done by a state worker funded by our taxes an unacceptable practice as well as the length of time it takes to approve the permit.?" - Jay, Aug 1</p>
