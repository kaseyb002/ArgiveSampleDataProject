Why can we not leave requirements in permit (dush shall not cross the property line andbe a nuisence) and leave it up to industry to accomplish the goals without being required to apply xx amount of water each run/day and documenting the information?" - June 22</p>

                <p class="quote">"We are attempting to add an additional paint booth to support an increased workload and to become more efficient. We already have three operational paint booths and have passed every Missouri DNR inspection we have been subject to. We have our eyes on a booth we'd like to add, but Platinum will be forced to pay a state engineer to review and approve the permit. In light of Missouri's new and very appreciated commitment to small business, we would hope that our tax dollars would be sufficient to cover the cost for a state funded agency to approve our permit. In addition, we have been informed that it will take up to three months to gain approval for the new booth. By then, the potential work may have dried up. " - Jeff, Aug 1</p>

                <p class="quote">"One of our issues we have now is the time it takes for the approval and issuing a permit of a paint booth we are needing to secure more work. We have been told that it takes up to three months to approve for a permit. Also we will be charged seventy five dollars an hour for an engineer to review and approve the permit. We believe that being charged extra for something that is being done by a state worker funded by our taxes an unacceptable practice as well as the length of time it takes to approve the permit.?" - Jay, Aug 1</p>
